# üîß Hugging Face Spaces API Endpoint Fix

## ‚ùå The Problem
Hugging Face Spaces with Gradio SDK doesn't expose FastAPI endpoints directly at the root URL. When you visit your space URL + `/graph`, it returns 404 because Gradio is handling all the routing.

## ‚úÖ The Solution
I've updated your `app.py` to provide **API functionality through Gradio** in two ways:

### Option 1: API Tester Tab (Immediate Solution)
Your updated `app.py` now has an "API Tester" tab where you can:
1. Select an endpoint (`/graph`, `/anomalies`, etc.)
2. Click "Test API Endpoint" 
3. Get the exact JSON response your admin dashboard needs
4. Copy the JSON structure to implement in your dashboard

### Option 2: Copy Functions to Your Admin Dashboard (Recommended)
Instead of making HTTP calls to the Hugging Face Space, copy the core functions from `main.py` to your admin dashboard:

```python
# In your admin dashboard backend
from your_main_file import (
    fetch_tokens_data, 
    run_anomaly_detection, 
    generate_main_scatter_payload,
    detect_rule_based_anomalies
)

def get_dashboard_data():
    df = fetch_tokens_data()
    results = run_anomaly_detection(df)
    graph_data = generate_main_scatter_payload(df.copy())
    
    return {
        'anomaly_count': results['ml_detected'],
        'chart_image': graph_data['image_data_url'],
        'insights': graph_data['insights']
    }
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Upload the updated files** to your Hugging Face Space:
   - `app.py` (updated with API tester)
   - `requirements.txt` (if needed)

2. **Test the API functionality**:
   - Visit your space: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Jatin2435/ration-anomaly-detection
   - Click on "API Tester for Admin Dashboard" tab
   - Test each endpoint and copy the JSON responses

3. **Implement in your admin dashboard**:
   - Copy the functions from `main.py` to your dashboard backend
   - Use the JSON structure from the API tester
   - Set up periodic data fetching in your dashboard

## üîó Alternative: Direct Integration
If you want to keep using HTTP calls, you could:
1. Deploy the FastAPI app separately (Heroku, Railway, etc.)
2. Use that URL in your admin dashboard
3. Keep the Gradio space for demonstration purposes

## üìã Updated File Structure
```
app.py - Gradio interface with API testing capabilities
main.py - Core FastAPI logic (copy functions from here)
requirements.txt - Updated dependencies
```

The updated `app.py` now provides a comprehensive interface that your admin dashboard can use to understand the API responses and implement the same functionality locally.
