    "questions": {
      "transparency": {
        "question": "How does blockchain ensure transparency?",
        "answer": "Blockchain creates an immutable, tamper-proof record of all transactions. Every delivery is recorded on the blockchain with timestamps, locations, and quantities, creating a permanent and publicly verifiable record that cannot be altered."
      },
      "hardware": {
        "question": "What hardware is required for implementation?",
        "answer": "The system requires minimal hardware - just smartphones for dealers and distribution centers to record deliveries and verify GPS locations. Government offices and NGOs can access the system through any internet-connected device."
      },
      "trust_scores": {
        "question": "How are trust scores calculated?",
        "answer": "Trust scores are calculated based on multiple factors including delivery accuracy, timeliness, customer feedback, and compliance with GPS verification. The algorithm is transparent and dealers can see exactly how their actions affect their score."
      },
      "offline": {
        "question": "Can the system work offline?",
        "answer": "Yes, the mobile application has offline capabilities that store transaction data locally until connectivity is restored. Once back online, the data is synchronized with the blockchain to maintain the integrity of the record."
      },
      "privacy": {
        "question": "How is user privacy protected?",
        "answer": "While the system ensures transparency of the distribution process, personal data of recipients is protected through encryption and access controls. The public can verify that deliveries occurred without accessing sensitive personal information."
